  "I will love you forever.",
  "To my special wife. My love for you is never-ending; my prayers were answered when I met you.",
  "You are the air that I breathe.",
  "I found the meaning of my life because of you, and I promise to love you forever.",
  "You are my best friend.",
  "You are the reason I became stronger, but still, you are my weakness.",
  "I would do anything for you to make you happy.",
  "I would give you the sun, the moon, the stars, and my whole heart forever.",
  "A good morning note to say how much I love you!",
  "There is no better feeling than holding you in my arms.",
  "My prayers were answered the day that I met you.",
  "You are a blessing in my life, and I will be lucky to call you my partner for the rest of our lives.",
  "Your smile is my everything.",
  "A goodnight note to say how in love with you I am!",
  "I love you now and forever.",
  "I will love you until I die, and if there is life after that, I will continue to love you then.",
  "The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that’s what you’ve given me. That’s what I’d hoped to give you forever",
  "I don’t need the heavens or the stars. I don’t need gold or riches. I gained everything I could ever want the day that I met you: I gained a steady hand, a kind soul, and someone who I will fall asleep with and wake up next to for the rest of my life.",
  "You are my heart – you are my everything."
